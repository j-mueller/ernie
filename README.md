[PERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_evaluation_and_review_technique) Project planning in Haskell

![docs/example.svg](docs/example.svg)

This is driven by my own needs / ideas about planning. Look at the source code of `Ernie.Example` to get started.

## Features (planned)

* Critical path: end 2 end, milestones
* Project start / end / duration
* Export samples to CSV

Maybe features

* Resource planning (maybe?)
* Combine plan with progress data

## Packages

* `ernie` Implements PERT charts
* `floyd-warshall` Implements the [Floyd-Warshall algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm). Based on a [blog post by Russell O'Connor](r6.ca/blog/20110808T035622Z.html)
